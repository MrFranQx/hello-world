# hello-world
Hello everyone!

I'm Franx and this is my test repository! I'll be learning Git and GitHub there.
I'm learning branching right now. Ok, bye!

Now I'm working locally. I have to learn a lot.

How can be a file staged and not staged at the same time?

git diff can be a great tool.

Especially with the --staged option.

I am testing the git commit -a option now.

Branching time again!

What has just happened???
